// into components.

// NOTE: This script should not contain or import any scripts containing rules,
// only things that are used by rules at compile time. Anything that outputs a
// css rule will get duplicated in each component that imports this script if
// so, because the components sccs styles are compiled independently to add
// angulars scope attributes.
